Letters is a Python script to examine a dataset of posts on the boards r/SuicideWatch and r/depression within Reddit. Due to the nature of these boards, they are a great way to exhibit suicidal ideation.

**The dataset used does not belong to me.** If a post you have made in one of these boards has been used within this dataset, it is a liability not mine. If you wish to get your post removed, please contact me about it.

#### Using The Script

This script does not require any external libraries to be used. 

To use the `autoswitch` function, you can simply type in autoswitch while in the view.

To quit the program, simply write `quit`.

To skip to a row in the dataset, type `skipto:` followed right after by the number of the row you want to go to.

The `cleanlog` command clears the wordcounter.txt file, which helps you receive the average amount of words used per post.
